\subsection{Detailed Description}
Java\+Shell does not use \char`\"{}real\char`\"{} directory paths, it uses paths that are relative to the users home directory

It presents what appears to be a directory tree that starts at the root directory / with the users files and directories within that directory, however, each user has their own private directory under the \char`\"{}real\char`\"{} directory shellroot. Each user is unable to see any of the other user\textquotesingle{}s files.

The file and directory paths input by the user and translated into \char`\"{}real\char`\"{} paths by prepending the user\textquotesingle{}s directory to it. In the same way any paths output by the programs are translated to make them into relative paths

For example\+:  /user/matt/javashell/shellroot/admin/test.txt becomes  /test.txt

Another security feature of the program is that directory paths are validated to prevent acccess outside the user\textquotesingle{}s directory. Paths passed to internal and external commands are checked to make sure that security problems cannot occur.
